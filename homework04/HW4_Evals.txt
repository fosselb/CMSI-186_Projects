   View SoccerSimTests.bat to see test parameters used
   Evaluation results are at the bottom of this file
======================================================

The Ball.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
takes at least four arguments for the x, y, dx, and dy values.  There
must be some sort of "move()" method.  There may be some sort of
"updateSpeed()" method but the computation may be done in move() with
no penalty.  There must be a "toString()" method to display the info
about the ball's location and speed.  There should be an "outOfBounds()"
method, but the computation may be done in the SoccerSim class instead.

The Timer.java or Clock.java class is optional.  If it exists, there is
one point each for the methods listed and any tests included.  Otherwise
this is a freebie, but the functionality of the computations MUST show
up in the SoccerSim.java class file somewhere/somehow.

The SoccerSim.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor
that initializes the simulation.  If the initialization is done in some
other method, that is OK, and credit is given for the constructor.  There
must be some method of validating arguments.  This may be done using the
provided method "validateArgs()" or can be done in the main() method if
that is desired.  There must be some kind of report facility, which can
be either a method "report()" or similar name, or can be done directly
in the simulation loop in another way.  There needs to be a facility to
detect collisions, which may be either a method like "collisionCheck()"
or can be done directly in the simulation loop.  There must be a main()
method which takes in and handles the argument checking, either directly
or through a method call to something like "validateArgs()".  There are
two points total [1/2 point for each] awarded for argument checking,
which covers:

   - right number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion (no letters)
   - time slice set to default if not on command line
   - time slice validated and set properly if it IS on the command line

Testing includes trials that should show ball[s] come to rest, should
show two balls colliding, and three others to show the balls all go off
the field, all come to a stop, and various ball counts are handled in
the output; the last three are worth a total of three points.

There must be at least two files in the repo: the Ball.java and the
SoccerSim.java files.  If there is a Timer/Clock.java file it is
ignored for credit since it was optional, AS LONG AS THE FUNCTIONALITY
IS AVAILABLE in one of the other two classes.

A total of one point each for the following, except where noted:

Total 32.44 out of 34 = 95.42% which is an A

Detailed omments:
=================
Running with no arguments produced an infinite loop.  Had to take a point off.
Same thing with only one argument, another point.  Still ran the sim with a
negative time slice; another point off.  Still ran with out of range time
slice, another point off.  Still ran, infinite loop, with zero time slice
value; another point off.

There were a couple of the tests that either had a collision or the balls all
stopped moving, not quite at the time I thought it would happen, but you still
detected the event, so I gave you credit for it.

Nice work!


Total course grade so far:
homework00 @  5%:  100.00% =  5.00 points
homework01 @  5%:  100.00% =  5.00 points
homework02 @  5%:  100.00% =  5.00 points
homework03 @ 10%:   96.30% =  9.63 points
homework04 @ 10%:   95.42% =  9.54 points
class part @ 10%:  100.00% = 10.00 points

                     total:  44.17 out of 45.00 points = 98.16% which is an A-plus
